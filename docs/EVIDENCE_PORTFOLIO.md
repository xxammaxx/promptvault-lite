## Next Step

- **Active:** Docs Baseline Sync (#207) — remove RED_HOLD on documentation.
- **Blocked:** v1.7.2 release — blocked until docs sync merged.
- **Planned:** Embeddings Phase 2 (#199) — DB schema/storage, still mock-only.
- **Planned:** Architecture Contract Audit, Security Posture Review.
